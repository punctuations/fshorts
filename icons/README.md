# Icon Placeholders

This directory should contain the extension icons:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons represent the fshorts extension.

For testing purposes, you can use any PNG images of the appropriate sizes, or remove the icons section from manifest.json temporarily.
